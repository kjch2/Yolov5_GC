Hey there! This is the sample dataset for the Roboflow guided tutorial.
It contains 12 images of a chess board with their pieces labeled in VOC XML format.

If you haven't already, you can begin the guided tutorial via your dashboard:
https://app.roboflow.ai

After completing the tutorial, you'll know how to use Roboflow to prepare
your own custom datasets for use with common computer vision models.

If you'd like a more detailed walkthrough, follow our quickstart guide here:
https://blog.roboflow.ai/getting-started-with-roboflow/

If you already have labeled images, that's great! We natively support most
common formats for import into Roboflow.

If you have images that aren't yet labeled, the easiest way to label them
is to follow our LabelImg data labeling guide:

Alternatively, we're happy to assist you with outsourcing and managing
your labeling jobs. Just get in touch with us: help@roboflow.ai
